WHAT IS THIS?

    This is a collection of notes and documentation I've written in the process
    of building my own operating system (see also:
	https://bitbucket.org/dgaur/dx and http://www.dangaur.com/portfolio/dx).

    I'd originally toyed with the idea of turning these bits into a longer
    whitepaper or even a book; and the outline is structured in that fashion.
    Since that seems highly unlikely now, figured I'd just post them online.


THIS DOCUMENTATION IS TERRIBLE!  WHO WOULD EVER READ THIS?!

    Be aware that these documents are extremely rough, since I wrote them as
	notes to myself, in my own cryptic shorthand, etc.

    That said, I've scrubbed them (slightly) for semi-readability; I still
    occassionally update or edit them; and I've been adding references
    periodically as I stumble across interesting new papers or sources, etc.

WHAT ARE THESE FILES?

    outline.md:     My OS development notes.  Semi-organized, and vaguely
                    chronological.

    references.md:  A list of books, papers, links and other resources on
                    OS development.  I've read some, but not all.  In a few
                    rare instances, assessments of the sources themselves,

    README:         this file.
